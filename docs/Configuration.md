PINF Configuration
==================

PINF configuration files are located at:

    ~/pinf/config/*.json

For information on the PINF directory structure see [DirectoryStructure](http://github.com/cadorn/pinf/blob/master/docs/DirectoryStructure.md).


credentials.json
----------------

Sensitive account information use by packages to authenticate with.

The exact structure of this file is undetermined. The idea is to identify credentials by matching a URL or namespace ID.


namespaces.json
---------------

[Namespaces](http://github.com/cadorn/pinf/blob/master/docs/Namespaces.md) registered with [PINF registry servers](http://github.com/cadorn/pinf/blob/master/docs/Registry.md).

This file can be auto-generated by contacting registry servers (*Not yet implemented*) and serves to map namespaces to registry servers.


registries.json
---------------

[PINF registry server](http://github.com/cadorn/pinf/blob/master/docs/Registry.md) credentials used to access the registry server API.


sources.json
------------

[Namespace](http://github.com/cadorn/pinf/blob/master/docs/Namespaces.md) to [Workspace](http://github.com/cadorn/pinf/blob/master/docs/Workspaces.md) mappings.

This is used to map catalog URLs to workspace directories by identifying packages by name and revision. The `sources.json` file is used by PINF to splice package sources into a dependency tree where local modification to an otherwise published codebase is desired.
