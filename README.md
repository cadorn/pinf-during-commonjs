Status
======

PINF is under **heavy development** and while some concepts are set in stone many details are a work in progress.

PINF is considered to be of **Alpha** quality meaning things are subject to change without notice. That being said we will
try hard to make changes as pain free as possible. After all we use PINF too and need the same migration paths.

Even though PINF is a young project, with some care it can be used in **production workflows**. We are
actively looking for **early adopters** to begin using PINF. This is essential to prove PINF as a generic
toolchain automation platform by ensuring it works with many different workflows and requirements.
